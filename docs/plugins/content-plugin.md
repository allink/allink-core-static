# Content Plugin (`allink_core/core_apps/allink_content`)

Our `Content Plugin` is basically the backbone of our page structure. It contains at least one `column` in which `plugins` (text, images, app plugins, ...) can be placed into.

Over the past year the options and features have evolved and been adjusted to meet most of our designer's requirements.

## Adding additional CSS classes to a `content-section`

In our `settings.py`, we have a tuple called `CONTENT_CSS_CLASSES`. As soon as it contains values, a new section `Predefined CSS Classes` will appear in the `Advanced Settings` block of a `Content Plugin`.

These classes are meant for reusable `content-section` styles across the entire site.

```Python
CONTENT_CSS_CLASSES = (
    ('example-class', 'This text will be used for the checkbox label'),
)
```

When selecting this option, our (simplified) markup will be extended:

```HTML
<div class="content-section example-class">
  ...
</div>
```

In our `static/scss/content-sections/_content-section.scss` we can then add the following:

```SCSS
.content-section {
  ...
  &.example-class {
    // in here we can overwrite existing or add new styles
  }
}
```

### Extending markup when certain option selected

Most of the time selecting one or more of the defined `CONTENT_CSS_CLASSES` only result in minor style changes. But sometimes additional markup is required.

Here's an example of how to achieve this:

Let's say you want to add markup when the option `example-class` has been selected.

Create the file `templates/allink_content/default/content.html` with this basic markup:

```HTML
{% extends "allink_content/content_base.html" %}
{% load staticfiles %}

<!-- for example: extending the "content_section_inner_before"  -->
{% block content_section_inner_before %}
    {% if "example-class" in instance.css_classes %}
        <!-- option specific markup  -->
    {% endif %}
{% endblock content_section_inner_before %}

```

Note: In this example we extended the block `content_section_inner_before`. Check out the [content_base.html](https://github.com/allink/allink-core/blob/v2.0.x/allink_core/core_apps/allink_content/templates/allink_content/content_base.html) template to see all available `{% block %}`s.

### Preselecting options
Options that should be preselected on creation of a content plugin can be added to the ```INITIAL_CONTENT_CSS_CLASSES``` list.

```
INITIAL_CONTENT_CSS_CLASSES = (
    'custom-container-width-1',
    'custom-container-width-2',
)
```

## Adding additional templates

Many ways lead to Rome. Most of the time, an additional CSS class as described above will do the job. But sometimes, especially when unusual column widths are required, then it makes sense to add a new column template.

In our `settings.py` we have a tuple called `ADDITIONAL_CONTENT_PLUGIN_TEMPLATES`. Here's an example:

```Python
ADDITIONAL_CONTENT_PLUGIN_TEMPLATES = (
    ('col-2-variation', '2 Columns (Footer)', 2, 'col-1-of-2'),
)
```

### Explanation

- <strong>col-2-variation</strong>: The class that will be added to the template.
- <strong>2 Columns (Footer)</strong>: The human friendly label text for the template dropdown.
- <strong>2</strong>: Amount of `Column Plugin`s that will automatically be created.
- <strong>col-1-of-2</strong>: The thumbnail <strong>width alias</strong> that per default is used for any images that are placed into a column. Note: This setting is not ideally solved, as there is no way define an image width per column. Check out [allink_image_tags](../templates/image.md) for more details on how to add custom thumbnail width aliases.

### Adding styles

Now we can do what ever we like with this custom template:

```SCSS
.content-section {
    &__template__col-2-variation {
      ...
    }
```

It might help to check out the default column styles in `node_modules/allink-core-static/scss/content-sections/_content-section.scss` in the section `Column Definitions`.

## Global spacings between content sections

Should you want to adjust the spacings of content sections, open `static/scss/base/variables/_content-section.scss`, search for `=section` to jump to the section and update the spacings for each breakpoint as desired.

The rest is already being taken care of in the `allink-core-static` repository.

## Hiding the features/options that are not required

This can help to reduce confusion among editors. The less they can do, the better. Keep it simple.

Currently, the only way to hide form fields is by using CSS. Open the file `static/scss/djangocms-custom-admin-style.scss` and add the following lines:

```SCSS
// hide unused fields
.field-overlay_enabled,
.field-ignore_in_pdf {
    display: none;
}
```

Please note: This is just an example. Make sure to only hide fields that are not in use for your project.

### How to figure out the name of the field

1. Browse the `allink-core` version defined in your `requirements.in` on github, open the file `allink_core/core_apps/allink_content/models.py` and copy the desired model field names after `.field-`.
2. Create a new `Content Plugin` or edit an existing one, and inspect the desired form element of the CMS modal with a DevTool and copy the class name.

## Spacings

In our `settings.py`, we have a tuple called `CONTENT_SPACINGS`. As soon as it contains values, a new section called `Spacings` will appear in the `Content Plugin`.
These are default spacings that can be used on a `Content Plugin` to control the spacings between the plugins.

```Python
CONTENT_SPACINGS = (
    ('y-section-1', 'Spacing Section 1'),
    ('y-section-2', 'Spacing Section 2'),
    ...
    ('y-scale-1', 'Spacing Scale 1'),
    ('y-scale-2', 'Spacing Scale 2'),
    ...
)
```

They can be set for `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` or both. All available spacings can be found in: `static/scss/base/variables/_spacings.scss`.

When selecting this option, our (simplified) markup will be extended:

```HTML
<div class="content-section y-section-1-top">
  ...
</div>
```

You can find further information about spacings [here](../stylesheets/spacings.md).
